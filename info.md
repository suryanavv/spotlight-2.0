Here's a detailed step-by-step approach to build your portfolio showcase platform using ShadCN, Vite, Firebase

### 1. **Authentication**

#### 1.1. Set up Google Sign-In using Firebase

- **Firebase Setup**: Go to Firebase Console, create a new project, enable Google authentication, and configure necessary API keys for your app.
- **Vite Setup**: Initialize your Vite project and install Firebase SDK for authentication.
- **Login with Google**: Create a Google sign-in button on the homepage.
- **Redirection after Login**: Implement logic to automatically redirect the user to the dashboard after successful login. Use Firebase’s auth state change listener.

### 2. **Homepage**

#### 2.1. Design the homepage layout using ShadCN

- **Create a Simple Intro Section**: Use ShadCN’s UI components to design the introduction part of your platform.
- **Sign-In with Google Button**: Add a Google sign-in button (conditionally rendered based on login state).
- **Redirect to Dashboard**: If the user is logged in, show a "Go to Dashboard" button instead of the sign-in button.

### 3. **User Dashboard**

#### 3.1. Design and implement the dashboard page

- **Use ShadCN for Layout**: Create a dashboard layout with sections for personal details, education, hobbies, and projects.
- **Fetch User Data from Firebase**: Upon login, fetch the authenticated user’s details from Firebase.
- **Create a Section for Project Management**: Add a section to list the user’s projects with buttons to add, edit, or delete projects.

### 4. **Profile Management**

#### 4.1. Create a form for users to input their personal information

- **Form for Personal Info**: Use ShadCN components to build a form where users can add personal information like name, education, and hobbies.
- **Save Data in Firebase Firestore**: After the user submits the form, save the data to Firebase Firestore under their user ID.
- **Display Data on Dashboard**: Fetch the saved data from Firestore and display it in the dashboard.

### 5. **Project Management**

#### 5.1. Create a page for users to add and edit their projects

- **Create Add/Edit Project Form**: Design a form using ShadCN for users to input project details (description, images, technologies used, links, etc.).
- **Save Projects in Firebase**: Store project details in Firestore. Each project should be tied to the specific user’s ID.
- **Display Projects on Dashboard**: Fetch and display the user's projects on the dashboard.

#### 5.2. Implement project details view

- **Project Overview Page**: When a user clicks on a project, navigate to a detailed view page. Fetch project-specific data from Firestore and display all project information (description, screenshots, links, etc.).

### 6. **Generate Shareable Portfolio Link**

#### 6.1. Implement unique shareable links

- **Generate Dynamic User Portfolio Link**: Use Firebase Firestore to create a unique portfolio link for each user based on their user ID.
- **Display Public Portfolio**: When someone accesses the link, show the user’s profile, education, hobbies, and projects without needing to log in.
- **Public Project View**: Make each project on the public portfolio clickable to show project details in a clean, user-friendly format.

### 7. **Deployment and Testing**

#### 7.1. Host the app on Firebase Hosting

- **Deploy to Firebase Hosting**: Set up Firebase Hosting to deploy your Vite app. Follow the Firebase documentation for deploying a web app.
