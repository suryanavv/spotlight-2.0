## Project Description

Spotlight is a cutting-edge platform designed to revolutionize content discovery by aggregating and highlighting trending topics, articles, and multimedia from diverse sources. It aims to streamline the way users stay informed and engaged by offering a dynamic and interactive experience.

The platform leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to provide personalized content recommendations, ensuring that users receive the most relevant and interesting information. Additionally, Spotlight fosters user interaction by enabling features such as liking, sharing, and commenting on content, thereby creating a vibrant community.

Technologically, Spotlight is built with a robust stack that includes React.js and Redux for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. Machine learning capabilities are powered by Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, while Docker and Kubernetes are employed for seamless deployment and scalability.
